# Password Generator
Simple python code to generate passwords for users.

# Program: 
Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generate a new password every time the user asks for a new password. If the user requests a password less than 8 characters then program should select a simple word from the attached words.txt.

# Remember the rules:
Please download the [words.txt](https://github.com/vikramtalware/Python/blob/master/Password%20Generator/words.txt) and store it in the same folder where your program is.
